OS evaluation prompt templates (clean, error-free)
Provides three helper functions that return ready-to-use prompt strings for
an evaluator, an optimizer, and an analyst agent. Each function accepts the
lesson_plan and skill_summary and returns a formatted prompt that asks the
agent to evaluate using CIDDP criteria: Clarity, Integrity, Depth,
Practicality, Pertinence.
